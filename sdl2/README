SDL Version Binded to: 2.07

Chez Scheme SDL2 bindings

These bindings are generated with the help of c2ffi

You can find it here: https://github.com/rpav/c2ffi 

First we use c2ffi to parse the headers and generate the json description:

c2ffi /usr/include/SDL2/SDL.h > sdl2.json
Optionally SDL2_net (in my case there was not a linux package so I installed from source:)

c2ffi /usr/local/include/SDL2/SDL_net.h  > sdl2-net.json

Then the scheme bindings are generated with the command:
scheme --script parse-sdl-json.ss

many *-functions.ss will be created
also sdl2.sexp will be generated.

You can then execute fossil diff --tk (or equivalent) to see the new functions
Then you should update sdl2.sls to add the new functions.

For new ftypes, enums and flags you'll need to figure out by hand.

This thing needs to be done once in a while when new SDL versions add new functionality. Usually you should not care :)
